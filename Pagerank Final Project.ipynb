We only numbers\n",

In fact, i'll ask you to if you have any questions, because start with simple examples, because this is how you're to get good at manipulating data data setsbefore we move on to noon pie and all that you have to get good at this.This is just a matter of exercising your knowledge of lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
